# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Building for Firebase Hosting (Default)

To build the application for Firebase Hosting (its primary configuration):

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a standard Next.js production build in the `.next` directory. Firebase Hosting is typically configured to serve this output.

## Building and Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

This project can also be built and deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). Cloudflare Pages uses Cloudflare Workers for dynamic Next.js features.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Install Wrangler CLI**:
    If you don't have it already, install the Cloudflare Wrangler CLI:
    ```bash
    npm install -g wrangler
    ```

2.  **Login to Cloudflare**:
    ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```

### Build for Cloudflare

To build the application specifically for Cloudflare Pages:

```bash
npm run build:cloudflare
```

This command uses `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` to output a `functions` directory (or similar, often `.vercel/output/static` and `.vercel/output/functions` which Cloudflare Pages can interpret) that is compatible with the Cloudflare Pages environment.

### Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

You can deploy to Cloudflare Pages using a few methods:

**1. Direct Upload with Wrangler (for testing or manual deploys):**

After running `npm run build:cloudflare`, you can deploy the output directly:

```bash
wrangler pages deploy .vercel/output/static --project-name <your-cloudflare-project-name>
```
(Note: The output directory might vary slightly based on `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` version. Check its documentation if `.vercel/output/static` is not correct. The build output will typically indicate the directory to deploy.)

Make sure to replace `<your-cloudflare-project-name>` with the name of your project on Cloudflare Pages. If the project doesn't exist, Wrangler might offer to create it.

**2. Git Integration (Recommended for continuous deployment):**

*   Push your code to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
*   In your Cloudflare dashboard, create a new Pages project.
*   Connect it to your Git repository.
*   **Build Configuration**:
    *   **Build command**: `npm run build:cloudflare`
    *   **Build output directory**: This will be the directory generated by `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`. It's often `.vercel/output/static` or simply the root if Pages detects a Next.js project correctly. Consult the `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` documentation or observe the build output for the exact directory. Cloudflare Pages might also auto-detect Next.js and configure this correctly.
    *   **Environment Variables**: Set any necessary environment variables in the Cloudflare Pages project settings (e.g., Firebase config if you decide to move them to environment variables, though client-side Firebase config is usually fine as is).

### Important Notes for Cloudflare Deployment:

*   **Firebase Services**: Your application's frontend will continue to interact with your Firebase backend (Firestore, Auth) as configured in `src/lib/firebase/firebase.ts`. Ensure your Firebase project's security rules allow access from your Cloudflare Pages domain if necessary (though typically not an issue for client-side SDK usage).
*   **Edge Runtime Compatibility**: Server Components, Server Actions, and API Routes in your Next.js application will run on Cloudflare's Edge Workers. Ensure any server-side code is compatible with the Edge runtime (e.g., avoid Node.js-specific APIs not available in Workers unless you configure Node.js compatibility for your Pages project).
*   The primary configuration of this app remains Firebase-centric. This Cloudflare setup provides an alternative deployment target for the Next.js frontend.
